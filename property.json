The chandeliers are custom-made by designers like Christopher Boots, Ochre, Lindsey Adelman, & Kelly Wearstler.\n\nThe villa comes with two versatile basements catering to a private gym & a private cinema. A visually stunning show kitchen designed for entertaining is complemented by a second fully equipped industrial kitchen. The villa is also complemented by a stylish study room.

This is the perfect choice for a new home in Al Barari and could also be a great option for an investor looking to make further upgrades.\n\nThe home is very spacious with 3.3-metre high ceilings and filled with light courtesy of floor-to-ceiling windows - the back of the villa has folding glass doors to create a smooth connection to the back garden. There are two living and dining rooms, one formal for guests and one for family. A beautiful upgraded family kitchen features a central breakfast island that can seat 8, with an adjoining prep kitchen. All of the flooring is upgraded, as is a powder room located on this level.\n\nThe built-up area of the villa has also been extended, adding to the interior space of each room, including the large en-suite bedrooms.
